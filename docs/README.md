# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome — this folder contains OctoAcme's Project Management process docs. Use this README as the single entry point to understand how we run projects and where to find process details, templates, and checklists.

## Brief overview of OctoAcme project management processes
OctoAcme organizes delivery around a lightweight lifecycle and clear roles to reduce friction and increase predictability:

- Initiation
  - Validate the problem and measurable outcomes.
  - Capture a Project One-pager and confirm stakeholders.
  - Decide go/no-go to enter planning.
  - See: Project Initiation Guide.

- Planning
  - Turn approved initiatives into a prioritized, estimated backlog and release plan.
  - Define Definition of Done, dependencies, and a risk register.
  - See: Project Planning.

- Execution & Tracking
  - Run predictable delivery rhythms (standups, weekly delivery syncs, demos).
  - Use the project board and PR workflows to manage work.
  - Track velocity, blockers, and key metrics.
  - See: Execution & Tracking.

- Risk Management & Communication
  - Maintain a Risk Register, review risks weekly, and follow defined escalation paths.
  - Use single-source status updates for stakeholders.
  - See: Risk Management & Communication.

- Release & Deployment
  - Follow pre-release checks (CI, security scans, release notes, rollback plan).
  - Automate deployments where possible and verify post-deploy.
  - See: Release & Deployment Guide.

- Retrospective & Continuous Improvement
  - Run retrospectives after sprints, releases, and incidents.
  - Convert action items into backlog issues and track impact.
  - See: Retrospective & Continuous Improvement.

## Team roles & responsibilities
- Project Manager (PM): coordinates delivery, risk, and stakeholder communications.
- Product Manager (PdM): defines outcomes and prioritizes work.
- Developers, QA, and other contributors: implement, test, and verify features.
- See: Roles and Personas.

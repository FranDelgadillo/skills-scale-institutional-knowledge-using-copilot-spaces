# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome — this folder contains OctoAcme's project management processes and templates. Use this README as the single entry point to understand how we plan, run, and improve projects.

## Brief overview of OctoAcme project management
OctoAcme runs projects with a customer-first, iterative approach. Key ideas:
- Deliver value in small, testable increments and iterate based on evidence.
- Define clear roles and outcomes (Project Manager, Product Lead, Developers, QA, Stakeholders).
- Follow an end-to-end lifecycle: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective.
- Proactively manage risks and dependencies with a lightweight risk register.
- Document decisions, acceptance criteria, and action items in the project repo for transparency and onboarding.

Core workflows at a glance:
- Initiation: validate problem, confirm stakeholders, produce a One-pager to decide go/no-go.
- Planning: prioritize backlog, estimate work, create release/milestone plan and Definition of Done.
- Execution: follow the project board and PR workflow, run CI/tests, and monitor key metrics.
- Release: follow deployment checklist, run smoke checks, and announce/verify post-deploy.
- Retrospectives: run blameless reviews, track action items, and feed improvements back into the backlog.

## How to use these docs
- Keep the Project One-pager and key artifacts (risk register, release notes, retros) in each project repo under docs/ or .copilot/ for Copilot Spaces to consume.
- Link to the most current status from the project README for stakeholders.
- When adding or changing process docs, use the repository's issue template: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/add-update-content-to-process-docs.yml

## Acceptance checklist (for this README)
- [ ] Content aligns with existing process docs
